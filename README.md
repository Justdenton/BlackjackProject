#### Week 3 - Homework - Skill Distillery

### Overview

* The program simulates a basic game of Blackjack, that will run 1 time. 

### How to Run:

* The user chooses run, then will be shown their first two cards, along with the dealer's face up card. Once the player is satisfied with their hand (and hasn't bust), the dealer will then draw cards until their hand reaches a value of at least 17.

### Technologies Used:

* Java
	* enum
	* APIE
	* Conditionals
* Git
* Eclipse IDE

### Lessons Learned

* Building classes in an object-oriented manner;
	* Using and accessing enums
	* Encapsulation - Allowing different parts of the program to handle different aspects of the game
	* Practice with toString() & hashCode()
* Testing and debugging
